# Complete RAG Pipeline Implementation - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines document processing, embedding generation, vector storage, and AI-powered question answering into a complete end-to-end system. This project focuses on creating production-ready RAG systems with proper document ingestion, semantic search, and context-aware response generation for intelligent document interaction.

## Project Objectives

1. **End-to-End RAG Architecture:** Design and implement complete RAG pipelines that seamlessly integrate document processing, embedding generation, vector storage, and response generation.

2. **Document Processing and Chunking:** Master document processing techniques including text extraction, intelligent chunking strategies, and content optimization for effective retrieval.

3. **Vector Storage and Retrieval:** Build efficient vector storage systems using FAISS with proper indexing, persistence, and high-performance similarity search capabilities.

4. **Embedding Generation Systems:** Implement robust embedding generation using sentence transformers with proper normalization, optimization, and quality assurance.

5. **Context-Aware Response Generation:** Create intelligent response generation systems that effectively utilize retrieved context to provide accurate and relevant answers.

6. **Pipeline Orchestration and Management:** Build comprehensive pipeline management systems with component testing, statistics tracking, and operational monitoring.
